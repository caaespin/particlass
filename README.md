<h1>Particlass: A crowdsource image classifier</h1>

This project is for the QBI Hackathon.

Particlass has a browser interface in which users help with the classification of random images into classes.

A REST API serves as the interface between the browser where people help with the classification, and the workflow that takes the user input for image classification.
